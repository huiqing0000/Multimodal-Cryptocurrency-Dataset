# Multimodal-Cryptocurrency-Dataset
Multimodal Cryptocurrency Dataset：BTC，ETH and BNB。

The project integrates HFT price time series and news information for three major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH and BNB). Transaction price data, including hourly time series for each cryptocurrency, comes from reputable financial data providers. Complementing this, hourly news data, including headlines and summaries, are scraped from the Cointelegraph website (https://cointelegraph.com/). The data sets for the three cryptocurrencies are as follows:

(1)BTC: Data spans from September 23, 2015, at 00:00 to April 7, 2024, at 19:00.
(2)ETH: Data spans from April 14, 2016, at 00:00 to April 7, 2024, at 15:00.
(3)BNB: Data spans from June 4, 2021, at 00:00 to April 30, 2023, at 23:00.

This data is used in the paper "Multimodal Cryptocurrency Volatility Prediction Analysis Based on LLM".
